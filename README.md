Hi, I'm Mark. I'm a librarian. I build tools to support libraries and their communities. I'm passionate about code education for everyone, self-directed learning, and the value of tinkering with our technologies. 

Libraries sit at the confluence of a lot of remarkable information tools. We librarians are well situated to build some interesting things using these resources. No need to wait for someone to build it for us; we can build it ourselves. Let's get to work.
